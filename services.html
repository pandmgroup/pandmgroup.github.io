                        <br/><br/>

                        <h2>What is the difference between your current broker and the service we provide?</h2>
Unfortunately what we find all to often is most insurance brokers are a limited portion of the insurance market to obtain quotes for their clients this often results in the consumer overpaying for their insurance and their product.
                        <br/><br/>
P&M Group will ensure you are put in contact with the few brokerages in New Zealand with the most access to the market which makes us extremely confident we can reduce what you pay on your annual insurance expenditure, whilst maintaining and or increasing your cover

                        <h2 >What is the advantage of using an insurance broker?</h2>
Cost – Contrary to popular consumer belief, studies have shown that brokers (whom are a free service) are cheaper that a direct insurer.
                        <br/><br/>
Why? Brokers are professionally trained to tailor the right policy for their clients, and not to uninsure. This avoids unnecessary claims, whilst maintaining the correct premium because of this, insurance providers will offer brokers special prices.
                        <br/><br/>
Having a broker will eliminate any communication when having to write a claim or take out a policy, as they mediate as the middleman to ensure there is no interruption in your business/personal time. 
                        <br/><br/>
Peace of mind – as a broker will tailor and service the insurance cover and policies around you, they will take into consideration any pre existing conditions to ensure you if the worst where to happen, you would be covered and the case would not be dismissed because of a pre existing condition.
